# Random groups

Need a way to way to divide up people in groups? Randomly? This app features:

- Manage your own groups (name of group and group members)
- Assign members randomly to groups
- Manual group sizes (you decide the size of each group)
- Uniform group sizes (all groups are the same size)
  - Toggle whether remainders get their own group, or are distributed to existing groups
- Assign a specific name to a specific group
- Randomize order within each group
- All data in LocalStorage, so zero GDPR issues

## TODO

- [ ] more responsive design
- [ ] 4 seconds of dramatic animation "while scrambling"

## Known bugs

- [ ] Assigning a wanted group to a member, with a higher number than there are groups, will crash the app
